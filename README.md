Mock website for skill display

## Description
The purpose of this website is to demonstrate my current capabilities of creating and styling a webpage in HTML and CSS. It came out more crude than originally imagined and offered a lesson of humility.

## Usage
Please use this website as an example of what happens when a student has not spent sufficient time learning the basics of HTML and CSS. 

## Credits
While nothing was copy / pasted, I did read code examples from the ASU Bootcamp class repository
